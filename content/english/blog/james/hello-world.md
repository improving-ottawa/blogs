#Hello World!
Before diving into specific topics I thought it would be appropriate to say hello and give you a sense of who I am and what I hope to write about.

I have been working in technology for about 30 years. I have always loved technology. The bulk of my career has been managing technologists, architecting solutions, and working with business leaders to develop technical strategies that align with the objectives of the business.

So it may be no surprise that a big chunk of the posts you find here are related to technology. Some about architecture, some about applying technology within a business, and some about managing technology and the teams that maintain it and the users who benefit from it. 

I have tried, over the course of my career, to be conscious about personal and professional development. Several people have asked me to coach them. There have been many people and books that have been instrumental in that effort. I plan on highlighting key ideas from these sources frequently.

When not working I enjoy spending time in the kitchen and roaming around the mountain west area. You may see some of my creations and adventures here from time to time too.

Until next time,

James

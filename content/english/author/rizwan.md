## Rizwan is a Senior Front-end engineer for Improving Ottawa. 

I make web apps look good, functional, and accessible.
 

I love working in the front-end because it's a constantly evolving landscape and there is no shortage of frameworks to learn and utilize. Currently I enjoy working with the Vue framework.

James is a Business Architect for Improving Ottawa. 

What that means in practice is I help companies look at their technology investments in a new way. I help them discover why systems struggle to scale, how to improve availability and performance, and how to set their teams up for greater success and improved delivery velocity. 

I love addressing business needs by applying technology. To me this is magical. But all too often we get trapped in a specific way of thinking which clouds our ability to see potential solutions. Pulling back the blinds and helping teams see things anew, to be a part of the energy this creates, and to walk with the team as they navigate this new landscape is extremely rewarding.

Outside of what I do for work I love traveling with my wife Leigh Anne, tromping around the mountains with my dog Ozzy, watching my three kids learn how to adult, and making delicious food.
